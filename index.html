                    <h3>Our Mission this Year</h3>
                    <p>Our mission is to create meaningful opportunities for UTVA students to connect, grow, and succeed. Through our innovative service project, we provide safe, inclusive spaces where students can receive academic support, spark creativity, and foster connections with peers.</p>
                    <p>This year, we’re introducing exciting new resources like a chat room for friend-to-friend support, a letter-writing room to spread kindness, and a digital resource library for exploring fun and educational content. Paired with the returning favorites—tutoring, language, and gaming rooms—we aim to inspire students to reach their full potential while contributing positively to the community.</p>
                    <p>By listening to the needs of our school, we hope to make a lasting impact that goes beyond academics. Together, we’re building a brighter future, one connection at a time.</p>
